If you have no idea what WMI is, then you should start reading about it :)
Start here(http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wmisdk/wmi/wmi_start_page.asp)


First, install WMI if you don't have it installed.
Windows 2000 and older come with WMI installed by default.
For the rest (win 9x and NT) you will have to download and install the WMI Core:
A list of downloads can be found here(http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/results.aspx?displaylang=en&freeText=wmi+core).
In any case, if the links above will become invalid/broken, you can find the downloads, information on Microsoft site, on MSDN.

To set up delphi, you need to start the Delphi IDE and import the following type libraries:


   1. Active DS Type Library (Version 1.0)
   2. Microsoft WMI Scripting v1.1 Library (Version 1.1)


Note: the versions are obolete since they will differ from system to system depending on the WMI version installed and so on, but you get the idea.
